// Need to talk to Paolo, to see if I'm going in the right direction, here. 

This program will do one thing, and one thing only: Automate trades on bitreserve.org, Kraken, or anywhere else that allows instant trading using the second derivative of historical prices.

Here is what the application does, and how it is done.

Initialize. 

Self-test. 

Repeat the following : 

Get price of Bitcoin. 

Record price of Bitcoin. 

Get price of Litecoin. 

Record price of Litecoin. 

Etc...

Do algorithm. (Example - Is Bitcoin price going down? Is Bitcoin price going up? Hath the moon doth waxed in fortnight past?) 

Bitcoin to Litecoin OR Litecoin to Bitcoin. 

The algorithm could be as simple as "Is the price going up?"

Execute trades.
If the price is going up, trade an amount of Litecoin for Bitcoin.
If the price is going down, trade an amount of Bitcoin for Litecoin.

This will basically just update coinbase-trader to work with BTC-e's API, and add the ability for a server to make trades.

This is probably obvious, but if one can access the price of bitcoin every 30 seconds,
micro-trading 1 bitcoin during a volatile period could turn a profit quickly, as follows :

Start : 1BTC, 100 LTC.

-- Price : 1 BTC / 70 LTC

/\ Price : 1 BTC / 71 LTC (Spend 2 LTC for 0.028 BTC.)

/\ Price : 1 BTC / 72 LTC (Spend 2 LTC for 0.028 BTC.)

-- Price : 1 BTC / 72 LTC (Do Nothing.)

/\ Price : 1 BTC / 73 LTC (Spend 2 LTC for 0.027 BTC.)

\/ Price : 1 BTC / 71 LTC (Spend .05 BTC for 3.55 LTC.)

End : 1.034 BTC, 102.45 LTC
Log.
